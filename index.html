                        <h3>Digital Transformation</h3>
                        Digital transformation often gets misunderstood; there has been a significant focus on the digital part thus far, but with scant regard for the transformational implications of it on the rest of the organization, and ultimately on those the organization serves. This misunderstanding is exactly why scarcely 1 in 8 digital transformation efforts are successful.<br>
                        <br>
                        Convergence's approach to digital transformation considers both the digital and the transformation facets of digital transformation. Our expertise and a deep understanding of the drivers of digital transformation allow us to help customers understand why an organization should undertake it. To successfully integrate digitization, your organization must consider important contemporary aspects like ethics and governance (corporate governance, IT governance, and data governance). These, as well as ensuring the alignment of your digital vision, are a critical factor for achieving success.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ultimately, digital transformation leverages new technology to create new markets, to create new or enhanced lines of business, or to create new or enhanced means of getting an organization’s products and services to those it serves. The results of digital transformation are therefore seen through the client/customer/citizen’s eyes as consistent, sustainable and satisfying service experiences, and through the organization’s eyes as enhanced revenue lines, optimized costing, and increased risk control. In other words, digital transformation is a process of two-way value creation. It is our goal to ensure that the probability of your digital transformation success significantly exceeds 1 in 8, enabling your initiative to not only create value for those you serve, but for your organization too.

                <h3>Kim Cameron</h3>
                Kim Cameron is a Canadian computer scientist and engineering leader who has worked since the
                emergence of the Internet to create a humanistic system of Digital Identity.
                Kim moved to Seattle to join Microsoft in 1999 when it acquired Toronto-based Zoomit Corporation, a
                software company dedicated to digital identity that he co-founded in 1980. In 2000 he became the
                Architect of Microsoft’s Active Directory, which evolved into the most widely deployed identity
                technology used in enterprises globally. As the growth of the Internet made the importance of identity
                increasingly evident, his role expanded to become Chief Architect of Identity for Microsoft, a position he
                held until his retirement in 2019.
                <br />
                <br />
                Kim led Microsoft to build technology that was part of an “identity metasystem” that worked across
                vendors, technologies and political boundaries. He introduced the concept of “claims” so the system
                could handle a world where the assertions of different entities were trusted for different things and to
                different extents – a major building block for what became cloud computing. In 2004 he wrote the Laws
                of Identity, a document that has long influenced both technologists and regulators, and which Microsoft
                adopted to guide its innovation. At the same time he began to champion innovations that would put
                users in control of their own identity as a way to solve the privacy and security problems of both
                individuals and organizations – work he continues to advance today.
                <br />
                <br />
                Kim grew up in Canada, attending King’s College at Dalhousie University and l’Université de Montréal.
                He served on RISEPTIS, the high-level European Union advisory body providing vision and guidance on
                security and trust in the Information Society. He has won a number of industry awards, including EEMA’s
                Lifetime Achievement Award (2012), the European Identity and Cloud Award for Lifetime Achievement
                (2013), the Identity North Founder of Canada’s Digital Economy Award (2016), Digital Identity World’s
                Innovation Award (2005), Network Computing’s Top 25 Technology Drivers Award (1996) and MVP
                (Most Valuable Player) Award (2005), Network World’s 50 Most Powerful People in Networking (2005),
                Microsoft’s Trustworthy Computing Privacy Award (2007) and Silicon.com’s Agenda Setters 2007. He has
                an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree from King’s College, and is on the Board of Directors for ID2020.

                <h3>Paul Makin</h3>
                Paul has been active in the specification, development and operation of digital financial services in both industrialised and emerging markets for more than 30 years. Over much of the last 15 year the focus has increasingly been on questions of identity, reflected in the development of strategies for customer onboarding in the light of developments in digital identity, KYC, the emerging KYC utilities, the growing emphasis on customer privacy and data protection, and the lack of conventional digital footprints amongst the so-called ‘digital natives’.
                Paul’s experience includes operational, technical and strategic elements of digital identity. For example, he led a team that developed and operated a digital identity service in Northern Nigeria, aimed at smallholder farmers in remote areas with limited or no network coverage. During the pilot, the team registered more than 500,000 farmers over a ten week period, issuing them with cards and giving them access to some basic financial services. 
                The Nigerian experience led to an engagement as part of the Safer Corridor project. Paul led a team that developed a detailed set of proposals and a proof of concept for a pilot digital identity service in Somalia. This pilot was intended to demonstrate innovative solutions for customer registration (DID/CDD/KYC/eKYC) and transaction monitoring (AML) in an environment with limited regulatory supervision and limited identity documentation. 
                Paul was engaged by the WFP to develop strategies for the deployment of privacy-protecting DIDs and associated customer onboarding processes (including eKYC) for social protection programmes across the developing world, with Egypt as the initial partner government. This resulted in the development of a generalised model of DID services for the delivery of such programmes that offers appropriate privacy and data protection controls, whilst allowing governments and others to deliver targeted assistance, and offering essential monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capabilities.
                On the strategic side, Paul has carried out a wide range of engagements relating to DID, for clients as diverse as the World Bank, Omidyar, the central bank of Nepal, CGAP, the government of Jersey, the South African authorities and FSD Africa. For example, for the World Bank, he studied and evaluated the various forms of identity available across emerging markets and assessed their effectiveness in enabling access to a range of financial services, with particular reference to their value in supporting eKYC. The review included both government-initiated identity services and private sector led initiatives, as well as emerging services such as those based around distributed ledger technologies (blockchain), and was accompanied by deep dives for India, Pakistan, Peru and Nigeria. The report culminated in a set of conclusions and policy recommendations, for consideration by both the World Bank and national authorities, specifically including the financial sector.
                Paul’s technical background is in digital identity, e-payments (including international card schemes, mobile payments and cryptocurrencies), digital banking, biometrics, cryptography and mobile communications, with experience gained in Europe, North America, Africa and South Asia. Paul holds a BSc (Hons) degree in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics.
