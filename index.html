                        <h3>Digital Transformation</h3>
                        Digital transformation often gets misunderstood; there has been a significant focus on the digital part thus far, but with scant regard for the transformational implications of it on the rest of the organization, and ultimately on those the organization serves. This misunderstanding is exactly why scarcely 1 in 8 digital transformation efforts are successful.<br>
                        <br>
                        Convergence's approach to digital transformation considers both the digital and the transformation facets of digital transformation. Our expertise and a deep understanding of the drivers of digital transformation allow us to help customers understand why an organization should undertake it. To successfully integrate digitization, your organization must consider important contemporary aspects like ethics and governance (corporate governance, IT governance, and data governance). These, as well as ensuring the alignment of your digital vision, are a critical factor for achieving success.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ultimately, digital transformation leverages new technology to create new markets, to create new or enhanced lines of business, or to create new or enhanced means of getting an organization’s products and services to those it serves. The results of digital transformation are therefore seen through the client/customer/citizen’s eyes as consistent, sustainable and satisfying service experiences, and through the organization’s eyes as enhanced revenue lines, optimized costing, and increased risk control. In other words, digital transformation is a process of two-way value creation. It is our goal to ensure that the probability of your digital transformation success significantly exceeds 1 in 8, enabling your initiative to not only create value for those you serve, but for your organization too.

                        <strong>Digital Transformation Webinar - January 27, 2021 12 PM - 1 PM EST</strong>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        "IT - Doing More with Less:  Serving students and institutional stakeholders"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        - Robyn Parr - Change and Opportunity Lead, Office of the Vice-Provost Students (secondment) & Associate Registrar & Director, Student Financial Service - Ryerson University
                        <br />
                        - Guy Pearce - Chief Digital Officer & Chief Data Officer - Convergence.tech
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With rapidly changing environments come rapidly changing student and stakeholder needs.  These changes put a strain on institutional resources - importantly on the people, and also on the IT systems, processes and governance, on which effective student services depend.  Change-management is a complex undertaking for all organizations, made more complicated with additional layers of complexity surrounding technology problems, solutions, and management.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This presentation looks at a case study involving Ryerson University and Convergence.tech, Trybe.ID's sister company, aiming to address these issues.  Initially envisioned as an event for Registrars, CTOs, and CIOs, all colleagues from educational institutions are welcome. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The presentation will start with a Problem statement describing service delivery challenges to university students and staff.  That talk then moves to steps taken to create a systematic approach to IT problem solving, resource assessment, and decision-making.  The university will share expected ROI, and both organizations will communicate learnings, challenges, and resolutions involving both technology and people.

                        Digital Credentials - The Past, Present, and Future: meeting highest standards
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        - Kim Cameron - Chief Identity Officer - Trybe.ID & former Microsoft Chief Architect of Identity
                        <br />
                        - Kim Hamilton Duffy - Architect, Digital Credentials Consortium & Dean, Digital Learning - MIT

                        <br />
                        Our understanding of digital identity has undergone important changes since the emergence of our digital lives, and especially over the past 20 years.  And, an evolving part of our understanding of  digital identity is our understanding of a digital credential, a “proof of qualification, competence, or clearance attached to a person...proving something about their owner...which may also contain personally identifiable information, including biometrics.”  Questions of our identity and relationship with technology, including implications for human agency are top-of-mind, as are our rights as citizens and our obligations in holding and creating the data of our fellow citizens.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This moderated presentation and discussion, from leaders in the field of digital identity, starts with the broad principles of identity, presented by our Chief Identity Officer, Kim Cameron, former Microsoft Chief Identity Architect, and author of the seminal 2005 Laws of Identity.  The talk then moves to hear from Kim Hamilton Duffy, Architect of the Digital Credentials Consortium at MIT, who shares the journey and thinking of the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC), from Open Badges, to Bockcerts, up to today’s Verifiable Credentials.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Guy Pearce, Convergence.tech Chief Digital Officer and Chief Data Officer finishes with guidance for institutional practitioners in adopting a technologically and morally robust set of guidelines and questions in support of a digital credential implementation plan, aligning with latest tech-sector principles and an institution’s own privacy standards and fiduciary responsibility.
                        These presentations will be followed by a short, moderated discussion and audience questions.  We look forward to an engaging event.

                        Digital Credentials and the Future of Learning: Roundtable Discussion
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        - Rob Jenkins - Global Chief of Education, UNICEF
                        <br />
                        - Borhene Chakroun - Director for Policies and Lifelong Learning Systems - UNESCO
                        <br />
                        - Janette Hughes - Canada Research Chair, Technology and Pedagogy, Ontario Tech University
                        <br />
                        - Mark Hansen - Superintendant, School District of Elmbrook
                        <br />
                        - John Pollaers - Chancellor, Swinburne University
                        <br />
                        - Stéphan Vincent-Lancrin - Senior Analyst - OECD Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI)
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With our globalized and globalizing lives comes the need for additional standardization of expectations and delivery around education credentials and their role in supporting employment outcomes.  At the same time, new models of learning are emerging, along with new skills and ways of delivering and recognizing them. This session is a round-table discussion, where we are joined by representatives of the OECD, UNESCO, UNICEF, an innovative and award-winning US high school district, a Canada Research Chair in Technology and Pedagogy and the Chancellor of a leading Australian university.  The conversation begins with a look at efforts contributing to the evolution of global education standards, then moves to a parallel perspective on new skills, delivery methods and learner flexibility.  Next, the discussion turns to the facilitating role in both movements played by the parallel evolution and understanding of digital credentials.  From there, we look at the future state of both learning and credentials, and audience members will have the opportunity to ask questions and contribute to future thinking in the space.
